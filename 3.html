<h2>why eipudu is so cute</h2>
<p>Cuteness is a subjective term describing a type of attractiveness commonly associated with youth and appearance, as well as a scientific concept and analytical model in ethology, first introduced by Konrad Lorenz.[2] Lorenz proposed the concept of baby schema (Kindchenschema), a set of facial and body features, that make a creature appear "cute" and activate ("release") in others the motivation to care for it.[3] Cuteness may be ascribed to people as well as things that are regarded as attractive or charming.[4]</p>
